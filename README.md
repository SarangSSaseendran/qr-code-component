### What I learned

This project, while seemingly simple, provided valuable insights into web development best practices, particularly regarding accessibility and SEO.

- Enhanced Meta Tags for SEO and Social Sharing: I learned the importance of comprehensive meta tags beyond just description and viewport. I implemented:

  - meta name="author" and meta name="keywords" for better search engine understanding.

  - Open Graph (OG) tags (og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url) to control how the page appears when shared on social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, ensuring a rich and consistent preview.

  - Twitter Card tags (twitter:card, twitter:title, twitter:description, twitter:image) for optimized sharing on Twitter.
  This significantly improves the discoverability and shareability of the web page.

- Improved Accessibility with ARIA and Alt Text:

  - role="region" and aria-labelledby: I gained a deeper understanding of ARIA landmark roles and how role="region" combined with aria-labelledby can semantically define important content sections. This makes navigation much easier for users relying on screen readers, allowing them to jump directly to key content areas.

  - Refined alt text: I focused on writing more concise and descriptive alt text for images, ensuring screen readers convey the image's purpose effectively without redundant information.

- Security Best Practices for External Links: I learned to always include rel="noopener noreferrer" when using target="_blank" for external links. This is a crucial security measure that prevents the opened page from gaining partial access to the original tab, enhancing user safety.

- Responsive Image Handling

### Continued development

I plan to continue focusing on:

  - Advanced ARIA attributes: Exploring more ARIA roles and attributes to further enhance the accessibility of future projects.

  - Performance optimization

  - Responsive design patterns: Practicing more complex responsive layouts to ensure seamless experiences across all device types and screen orientations.
